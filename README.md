![](https://github.com/ukokobili/disney_movies_analysis/blob/main/Image/Disney.jpeg)

For this analysis, I used a dataset containing all 579 movies between 1937 and 2016 released by Disney to determine the top 20% of Movies that brought 80% of Disney's Gross Income, using the Pareto principle. The data for this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/disney-movies-19372016-total-gross)
