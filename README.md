For this analysis, I used a dataset contains all 579 movies betwem 1937 and 2016 released by Disney to determine the top 20% Movies that brought 80% of Disney's Gross Income, using the Pareto principle. The data for this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/disney-movies-19372016-total-gross)
